# Decision Forge AI
AI-Driven Human Risk Simulation Platform for Cybersecurity Decision Intelligence

---

## Overview

Decision Forge AI is a structured simulation platform designed to evaluate and strengthen cybersecurity decision-making under adversarial conditions.

The system models realistic scenarios including phishing attempts, credential misuse, social engineering interactions, and operational security dilemmas. Participants are assessed on risk recognition, containment discipline, and adaptive reasoning through structured branching logic and controlled feedback mechanisms.

Core Components:
- Scenario-based adversarial simulation
- Behavioral decision scoring framework
- Baseline and post-interaction performance measurement
- Governance-aligned feedback reinforcement

---

## Research Objectives

- Evaluate the effectiveness of AI-assisted human risk simulation
- Measure pre- and post-interaction decision quality
- Assess behavioral improvements in adversarial awareness
- Explore structured approaches to AI-enabled cybersecurity training
