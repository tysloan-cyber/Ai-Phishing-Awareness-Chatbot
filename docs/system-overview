# CyberQuest System Overview

## Purpose

CyberQuest is an AI-driven cybersecurity awareness evaluation system designed to measure and improve phishing and social engineering detection across diverse professional environments.

The system combines structured assessment, dynamic profession-based personalization, controlled scoring, and reflective reinforcement within a research-aligned framework.

---

## Architectural Philosophy

CyberQuest operates using two integrated layers:

1. Dynamic Personalization Layer  
2. Research Control Layer  

The Personalization Layer adapts scenario context to the participant’s selected profession.  
The Research Control Layer enforces structural, scoring, and evaluation integrity.

This separation ensures realism without sacrificing experimental consistency.

---

## Core Flow Structure

CyberQuest follows a fixed three-phase sequence:

1. Baseline Assessment  
2. Storyline Training  
3. Reassessment  

This sequence never changes.

The system does not allow structural reordering or bypassing of phases unless the participant explicitly discontinues the session.

---

## Profession-Based Personalization

At session start, participants enter their profession, role, or operational environment.

Examples include:

- Healthcare
- Education
- Finance
- Retail
- Government
- Technology
- Small Business
- Other user-defined roles

Scenarios are dynamically generated to reflect real-world risks within the participant’s domain.

The system does not rely on a static predefined track list. Instead, it uses contextual intelligence to tailor scenario framing appropriately.

Scoring rules remain identical across professions.

## Assessment Model

### Baseline (Pre-Test)

- 5 scenario-based questions  
- 10 points per question  
- Maximum score: 50  
- No feedback during assessment  
- No priming or titled prompts  

Purpose: Measure initial detection ability without influence.

---

### Storyline Training

- 10 profession-aligned scenarios  
- 10 points per scenario  
- Maximum score: 100  
- Immediate explanation and principle reinforcement  

Purpose: Deliver immersive, applied cybersecurity learning.

Dynamic explanation is permitted during this phase, but scoring structure is fixed.

---

### Reassessment (Post-Test)

- 5 scenario-based questions  
- 10 points per question  
- Maximum score: 50  
- Different from baseline  
- Comparable difficulty  
- No priming or titled prompts  

Purpose: Measure learning transfer.

Improvement is calculated as:

Reassessment – Baseline

Range: -50 to +50

---

## Scoring Engine

- Correct answer: 10 points  
- Incorrect answer: 0 points  
- No negative scoring  
- No partial credit  

The scoring structure is invariant across professions and sessions.

---

## Anti-Priming Safeguards

To preserve research validity:

- Baseline and reassessment questions are untitled.
- No thematic hints are provided.
- Feedback is withheld until assessment completion.
- Topic categories are never revealed during assessment phases.

---

## Session Discipline

CyberQuest maintains structured progression.

The system:

- Redirects off-topic responses.
- Does not abandon assessment flow.
- Only terminates session upon explicit user request.

---

## Reflection and Reinforcement

Following reassessment, participants complete a structured reflection.

The system provides a personalized takeaway statement highlighting:

- Growth in risk recognition  
- Improvement in decision-making  
- Increased confidence  
- Newly acquired awareness  

This reinforces learning retention beyond raw scoring.

---

## Data Handling and Privacy

CyberQuest:

- Does not store personal identifiers.
- Does not retain cross-session memory.
- Does not collect unnecessary demographic data within session.
- Requires participants to self-record scores externally.
