## Behavioral Evaluation Framework

Decision Forge AI employs a controlled three-phase evaluation structure designed to measure cybersecurity decision quality and learning transfer under adversarial conditions.

### Evaluation Phases

1. Baseline Assessment (Pre-Evaluation)  
2. Adversarial Simulation Phase  
3. Reassessment (Post-Evaluation)

Scenario content is dynamically tailored to the participant’s selected profession or role. However, scoring logic and evaluation structure remain consistent across all professional contexts to preserve methodological integrity.

## Scoring Model

Each scored scenario is evaluated using a fixed binary structure:

- Correct response: 10 points  
- Incorrect response: 0 points  
- No partial credit  
- No negative scoring  

Scoring parameters remain constant across professions and evaluation phases.

## Assessment Structure

### Baseline Assessment

- 5 scenario-based questions  
- 10 points per question  
- Maximum score: 50  
- No feedback provided during evaluation  
- No priming language or titled cues  
- No explanation until completion  

Purpose: Measure initial adversarial detection and decision capability.

---

### Adversarial Simulation Phase

- 10 scenario-based interactions  
- 10 points per scenario  
- Maximum score: 100  
- Immediate contextual feedback after each response  
- Profession-specific contextualization  
- Structured explanation permitted  

Purpose: Reinforce defensive reasoning and least-privilege decision alignment.

---

### Reassessment

- 5 scenario-based questions  
- 10 points per question  
- Maximum score: 50  
- Distinct from baseline scenarios  
- Comparable difficulty level  
- No feedback until completion  

Purpose: Measure knowledge transfer and behavioral improvement.

---

## Performance Delta Analysis

Improvement Delta = Reassessment Score – Baseline Score  

Range: -50 to +50

Interpretation:

- Positive value: measurable improvement  
- Zero: no measurable change  
- Negative value: performance decrease  

Percentage calculations:

- Baseline % = (Baseline ÷ 50) × 100  
- Simulation % = (Simulation ÷ 100) × 100  
- Reassessment % = (Reassessment ÷ 50) × 100  

---

## Profession-Based Personalization

Scenario content is dynamically contextualized to the participant’s selected role, including but not limited to:

- Healthcare  
- Education  
- Finance  
- Retail  
- Government  
- Technology  
- Small Business  

Scoring logic remains identical across all tracks to preserve experimental consistency.

---

## Research Controls

To maintain evaluation integrity:

- Baseline and reassessment phases are non-primed and untitled  
- Feedback is withheld during formal assessments  
- Scoring parameters are fixed  
- No adaptive retesting occurs during evaluation  
- Dynamic interaction is restricted to the simulation phase  
- Participants self-record scores externally  

---

## Data Handling

Decision Forge AI does not store:

- Personal identifiers  
- Cross-session memory  
- Participant score history  

All data collection occurs externally via structured participant reporting mechanisms.
